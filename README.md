Armonia Name Service (`ANS`)

# Purpose
In order to achieve the most decentralization, domain name service must be supported as part of the Armonia decentralization technology stack, hence the name of DDNS, i.e. decentralized name service. `ANS`` is the official code name for DDNS implementation.

`ANS` is different from premimum account name bidding. Instead it is created to provide domain name resolution on-chain!

# Supported ANS Types
- A: domain name including TLD like .com .eth .btc 
- AAAA: IPv4 E.g. `192.168.100.1` 
- URI: uri content
- TXT: any key-value record
