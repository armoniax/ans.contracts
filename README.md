Armonia Name Service (`ANS`)

# Purpose
In order to achieve the most decentralization, domain name service must be supported as part of the Armonia decentralization technology stack, hence the name of DDNS, i.e. decentralized domain name service. `ANS` is the official code name for `DDNS` implementation.

`ANS` is different from premimum account name bidding. Instead it is created to provide domain name resolution on-chain!

# TLD domain names

Top-level domain names are reserved and cannot be owned by common users. Following are the list of TLDs:

- com
- eth
- btc

The above list will be extended/updated by `ANS DAO` along the way.

# Supported ANS Types
- A: domain name including TLD like `.com` `.eth` `.btc` 
- AAAA: IPv4 E.g. `192.168.100.1` 
- URI: uri content
- TXT: any key-value record 


# Ownership cost

# Name bidding market
